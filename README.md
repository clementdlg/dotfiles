# Server Config Files
## Description
- this branch hosts the dotfiles for server administration tools

## Scope
- the tools should be CLI/TUI only
- the tools should make sense on a production server (e.g. : no neofetch)
- these configs should not override defaults, only extend them where it make sense
- external plugins are not used for security reasons
- these configs are geared towards ssh + terminal-emulator but should still be usable in the console

## Tools
- bash
- vim
- tmux
